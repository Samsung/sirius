		<p>This document describes how to use modelers created using Sirius. This includes graphical, tabular and hierarchical (tree) modelers. The Sirius system includes everything necessary to easily 
			<em>define</em>  these modelers (on any standard or Domain Specific Model/Language) and then 
			<em>use</em> them to create and manipulate actual models. This document is targeted to end users who will use already defined modelers. If you want to learn how to define your own, refer to the 
			<a href="../specifier/Sirius%20Specifier%20Manual.html">
				<strong>Sirius Specifier Manual</strong>
			</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Note that each specific modeler will have its own set of features, and not all of the make use of all the possibilities of Sirius while others may contain custom extensions. However they all share the same common behaviors, which are described here.</p>
