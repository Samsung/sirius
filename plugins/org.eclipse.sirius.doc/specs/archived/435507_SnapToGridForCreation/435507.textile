h2. Introduction

If "Snap To Grid" property is enabled (in the "Rulers & Grid" tab of diagrams properties view), elements (node or edge) should be created on the grid.

Currently, with the "Snap To Grid" property enabled, with "Ruler Units"=Pixels and "Grid Spacing"=100, if you create a node by clicking on coordinates (125,125), the node is created to (125,125). It should be created to (100, 100), ie the nearest step grid.

This enhancement will not be available for sequence diagrams because "Snap To Grid" is not supported for this kind of diagram (see documentation for more explanations).

h2. Detailed Specification

When "Snap To Grid" property is enabled, the moved elements are aligned on the grid but this is not the case during the creation. The goal of this enhancement is to have the same location if an element is moved on a point or created on this same point.
This enhancement is available for all kind of created elements: node, container and edge. You can refer to the section "Tests and Non-regression strategy/Test cases" for details of each cases to support.

The two classes @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.palette.CreationTool@ and @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.palette.ConnectionCreationTool@ should adapt the request location in @updateTargetRequest()@ according to the "Snap To Grid" property state.

Limits:
* This enhancement will not be available for sequence diagrams because "Snap To Grid" is not supported for this kind of diagram (see documentation for more explanations). But an enhancement should be created to properly disable the SnapToGrid on Sequence diagrams.
* This enhancement will not be available for default GMF elements: Note, Text and Note Attachment. It seems possible to change the behavior for this kind of elements (in method @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.palette.PaletteManagerImpl.updatePalette(Diagram)@) but this is not the goal of this enhancement.
* This enhancement does not affect the case where the element is created to the center of the visible part of the diagram and not where the user has clicked. For information, this case is possible if a tool creates an element outside of the selected element. It would be possible to adapt this behavior but it does not seem user friendly.

h3. Edge case

The edge case is specific. Indeed, when the user clicks the first time (for source location), the best location depends on the second click (target location). So the real locations (source and target) are only computed after these 2 clicks (in org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.graphical.edit.policies.SiriusGraphicalNodeEditPolicy.getConnectionCompleteCommand(CreateConnectionRequest)).

__Default behavior: the anchors are aligned to the grid__

But the end user is not aware of the anchors existence. So it is more user friendly to align the edge ends to the grid.

h3. Existing bugs

During the analysis of this issue, bugs have been discovered. They should be ideally be fixed but it is not in the scope of this evolution.
* Create a border node on the left side of a container with vertical scroll: The creation location is wrongly shifted according to the container scroll and can be, in some case, created to the bottom side. The corresponding bug is "Bugzilla #437544":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437544 .

* Moving a collapsed border node with the snap to grid enabled, aligns the collapsed border node with the grid crossing. It should align the expanded state to the grid crossing (and not the collapsed state).

h2. Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths

h3. Metamodel Changes

There is no change in metamodel for this evolution.

h3. API Changes

This evolution does not change any API.

h3. User Interface Changes

No user interface change.

h3. Documentation Changes

This new behavior should be added in the New and Noteworthy documentation. There is no need to document this elsewhere because it became the default behavior.

h2. Tests and Non-regression strategy

h3. Existing tests

Existing tests should be adapted to this new feature.

h3. Test cases

This chapter lists all different cases that should be tested for this enhancement.

Each above cases should be tested:
* with different zoom factor: 75%, 100%, 200%
* with and without scroll (in diagram and in container). Note that the scroll on diagram has no impact on the grid: the scroll shift the diagram and its grid (the scroll pane contains the diagram figure and its grid layer).

h4. Create a container

The container should be created on the nearest grid crossing.

h4. Create a node

Cases: Create a node on the diagram or in container.

The node should be created on the nearest grid crossing.

h4. Create a border node

Cases:
* Create a border node on a container, on a node or on a node in container.
* Collapsed or not
** If the border node is created collapsed, it is not aligned to the grid. The expanded state of this border node is aligned to the grid, so the collapsed state is not.
The border node should be created on the nearest grid crossing, as close as possible. Indeed, one of the coordinates (x or y) is constrained by the parent border. The location is also constrained by other border nodes on the selected container.
For north and south border node, only the x axis grid crossing is considered (the y axis is fixed by the parent north, or south, border).
For east and west border node, only the y axis grid crossing is considered (the x axis is fixed by the parent east, or west, border).

h5. Specific cases

* 2 border nodes with same creation location
** The first border node is aligned on the grid. But the second can not. It is shift to have a location near the grid crossing but just at the side of the first border node.
* no corresponding grid crossing on the selected container

h4. Create an edge

The starting point and the ending point of the edge should be aligned on the grid crossing, as close as possible. Indeed, one of the coordinates (x or y) is constrained by the connected side of the source/target.

h5. Specific case

* no corresponding grid crossing on the selected source node or target node

h4. Create an edge and simultaneously 2 border nodes at each extremity

This is a particular case where border nodes and edge are created together with the same tool. The border nodes should be created as if they are created apart.

h4. Specific case for creation in a container

h5. With scroll (horizontal or vertical) in container

For all creation in a container with scroll, the node (border or not) is created according to global grid and not to a potential internal grid to the container. The scroll is not really considered in this case.
We should make attention to avoid any disturbing effect: after the node creation, the scroll bars should not be reset. Even if the scroll is not really considered, the node should be created on the closest grid crossing, but the real location is a scrolled one (current behavior), we have just to align the location to the global grid.

h5. The grid does not cross the container

In case of a large grid spacing, it is possible that the grid does not cross the container. In this case, the coordinates are constrained by the bounds of the container and are set according to the nearest grid crossing.

h2. Implementation choices and tradeoffs

If the centered in visible part creation (marked as known limitation) is finally needed, the impacted code will be in the method @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.business.internal.view.SiriusLayoutDataManagerImpl.calculateCenterLocation(IGraphicalEditPart, CompoundCommand, IAdaptable, Point)@.
