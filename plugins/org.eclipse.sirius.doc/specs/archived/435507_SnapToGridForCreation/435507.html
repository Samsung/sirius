It should be created to (100, 100), ie the nearest step grid.</p><p>This enhancement will not be available for sequence diagrams because &#171;Snap To Grid&#187; is not supported for this kind of diagram (see documentation for more explanations).</p><h2 id="DetailedSpecification">Detailed Specification</h2><p>When &#171;Snap To Grid&#187; property is enabled, the moved elements are aligned on the grid but this is not the case during the creation. The goal of this enhancement is to have the same location if an element is moved on a point or created on this same point.<br/>This enhancement is available for all kind of created elements: node, container and edge. You can refer to the section &#171;Tests and Non-regression strategy/Test cases&#187; for details of each cases to support.</p><p>The two classes <code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.palette.CreationTool</code> and <code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.palette.ConnectionCreationTool</code> should adapt the request location in <code>updateTargetRequest()</code> according to the &#171;Snap To Grid&#187; property state.</p><p>Limits:</p><ul><li>This enhancement will not be available for sequence diagrams because &#171;Snap To Grid&#187; is not supported for this kind of diagram (see documentation for more explanations). But an enhancement should be created to properly disable the SnapToGrid on Sequence diagrams.</li><li>This enhancement will not be available for default GMF elements: Note, Text and Note Attachment. It seems possible to change the behavior for this kind of elements (in method <code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.palette.PaletteManagerImpl.updatePalette(Diagram)</code>) but this is not the goal of this enhancement.</li><li>This enhancement does not affect the case where the element is created to the center of the visible part of the diagram and not where the user has clicked. For information, this case is possible if a tool creates an element outside of the selected element. It would be possible to adapt this behavior but it does not seem user friendly.</li></ul><h3 id="Edgecase">Edge case</h3><p>The edge case is specific. Indeed, when the user clicks the first time (for source location), the best location depends on the second click (target location). So the real locations (source and target) are only computed after these 2 clicks (in org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.graphical.edit.policies.SiriusGraphicalNodeEditPolicy.getConnectionCompleteCommand(CreateConnectionRequest)).</p><p><img border="0" src="images/edgeCreation_defaultBehaviorWithSnap.png"/><br/><i>Default behavior: the anchors are aligned to the grid</i></p><p>But the end user is not aware of the anchors existence. So it is more user friendly to align the edge ends to the grid.</p><p><img border="0" src="images/edgeCreation_expectedBehaviorWithSnap.png"/><br/><i>Expected behavior: the edge ends are aligned to the grid</i></p><h3 id="Existingbugs">Existing bugs</h3><p>During the analysis of this issue, bugs have been discovered. They should be ideally be fixed but it is not in the scope of this evolution.</p><ul><li>Create a border node on the left side of a container with vertical scroll: The creation location is wrongly shifted according to the container scroll and can be, in some case, created to the bottom side. The corresponding bug is <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437544">Bugzilla #437544</a> .</li></ul><p><img border="0" src="images/bug-borderNodeCreationWithContainerScroll.png"/></p><ul><li>Moving a collapsed border node with the snap to grid enabled, aligns the collapsed border node with the grid crossing. It should align the expanded state to the grid crossing (and not the collapsed state).</li></ul><p><img border="0" src="images/bug-borderNodeMovedWithSnapToGridEnabled.png"/></p><h2 id="BackwardCompatibilityandMigrationPaths">Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths</h2><h3 id="MetamodelChanges">Metamodel Changes</h3><p>There is no change in metamodel for this evolution.</p><h3 id="APIChanges">API Changes</h3><p>This evolution does not change any API.</p><h3 id="UserInterfaceChanges">User Interface Changes</h3><p>No user interface change.</p><h3 id="DocumentationChanges">Documentation Changes</h3><p>This new behavior should be added in the New and Noteworthy documentation.

Indeed, one of the coordinates (x or y) is constrained by the parent border. The location is also constrained by other border nodes on the selected container.<br/>For north and south border node, only the x axis grid crossing is considered (the y axis is fixed by the parent north, or south, border).<br/>For east and west border node, only the y axis grid crossing is considered (the x axis is fixed by the parent east, or west, border).</p><h5 id="Specificcases">Specific cases</h5><ul><li>2 border nodes with same creation location<ul><li>The first border node is aligned on the grid.

The scroll is not really considered in this case.<br/>We should make attention to avoid any disturbing effect: after the node creation, the scroll bars should not be reset. Even if the scroll is not really considered, the node should be created on the closest grid crossing, but the real location is a scrolled one (current behavior), we have just to align the location to the global grid.</p><h5 id="Thegriddoesnotcrossthecontainer">The grid does not cross the container</h5><p>In case of a large grid spacing, it is possible that the grid does not cross the container. In this case, the coordinates are constrained by the bounds of the container and are set according to the nearest grid crossing.</p><h2 id="Implementationchoicesandtradeoffs">Implementation choices and tradeoffs</h2><p>If the centered in visible part creation (marked as known limitation) is finally needed, the impacted code will be in the method <code>org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.business.internal.view.SiriusLayoutDataManagerImpl.calculateCenterLocation(IGraphicalEditPart, CompoundCommand, IAdaptable, Point)</code>.</p></body></html>
