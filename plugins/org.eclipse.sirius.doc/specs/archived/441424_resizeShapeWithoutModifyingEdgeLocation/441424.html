This enhancement aims to hold the edges location during the shape resizing.</p><p>The current behavior:<br/><img border="0" src="animated_current.gif"/></p><p>The expected behavior after this enhancement:<br/><img border="0" src="animated_after.gif"/></p><h2 id="DetailedSpecification">Detailed Specification</h2><ul><li>This enhancement will guarantee that edges connected to a shape side (East, West, North or South), will keep their location if the user resizes this shape from an other side or an opposite corner. For example, edges connected on the East side will keep their location if the user enlarges the shape toward the North, West, South or North-West, South-West.</li></ul><ul><li>If the user reduces the shape size, we hold the edge location while they are still within the reduced bounds. That means if we reduce a container bounds from the south-west corner toward north-east direction, edges connected on the East side will move if their connections are out of the new shape bounds.</li></ul><h2 id="BackwardCompatibilityandMigrationPaths">Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths</h2><p>This evolution does not change any API.</p><h3 id="UserInterfaceChanges">User Interface Changes</h3><p>No user interface change.</p><h3 id="DocumentationChanges">Documentation Changes</h3><p>This new behavior should be added in the New and Noteworthy documentation. <br/>A note should also be added in the user doc to explain the new behavior.</p><h2 id="TestsandNonregressionstrategy">Tests and Non-regression strategy</h2><p>Add new tests that enlarge a node, a border node and a container with several edges connected on every side.<br/>We should also test the &#8220;centered&#8221; resize with the &#8220;ctrl&#8221; key pressed.<br/>Sample of tests that resize elements:</p><ul><li>org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.sequence.InteractionUseResizeTests</li><li>org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.PortPositionStabilityTest</li></ul><h2 id="Implementationchoicesandtradeoffs">Implementation choices and tradeoffs</h2></body></html>
