h2. Introduction

As explained in specification of "bug 463485":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463485, ??the _Snap To Shapes_ feature is not operational when moving or resizing a border node.??. The goal of this feature is to make operational the _Snap To Shapes_ feature even on border nodes, and also to benefit of the same feature as "bug 463485":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463485 (ie "snap to all shapes", and not only snap to brothers). You can see "specification":http://git.eclipse.org/c/sirius/org.eclipse.sirius.git/plain/plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/accepted/463485_snapToAllShapes/463485.html?h=v3.1.x of bug 463485 for details about "snap to all shapes" feature.

h2. Detailed Specification

The _Snap To Shapes_ feature is natively not supported by GMF. Probably because the interest is limited. It allows only to snap to another border node on the opposite side:
!snapToBrotherBorderNode.png!

But with the option to "snap to all shapes" (with F4 shortcut key), this feature becomes interesting even for border nodes. To align "in" border node with "out" border node for example:
!snapToAnotherBorderNode.png!

To avoid too many snap guides, only center guides (horizontal and vertical) will be considered. Indeed, generally, the border nodes are small and the main goal of this feature is to align the center of border nodes. So contrary to other shapes where the guides are for bottom, center and top, or left, middle and right. Only center and middle guides are used for border nodes.

h3. Collapsed border nodes

The border node can be collapsed (with a filter for example). In this case:
* If the moved border node is collapsed, the collapsed border node is snapped to other shapes (not its expanded bounds).
* If the moved border node is snapped to a collapsed border node, the behavior will be the same as other kind of nodes currently. It will be snapped to the collapsed border node (and not to its expanded bounds).

For example in the below screenshot:
* A - All border nodes are collapsed through a filter. A collapsed border node is aligned to another collapsed border node.
* B - This is the result.
* C - And if the filter is disabled, border node are expanded and always aligned.

Another example with a snap of a normal border node to a collapsed one:
* A - Some border nodes are collapsed through a filter. A standard border node is aligned to a collapsed border node.
* B - This is the result.
* C - And if the filter is disabled, border node is expanded and always aligned.

h3. Known limitations

As a reminder (See "Sequence diagram introduction":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/user/sequences/Sequence%20Diagrams.html#introduction), the snap features (snap to grid or snap to shapes) are disabled in sequence diagrams. This will obviously also the case for border nodes even with this improvement.

h3. Technical details

The @SiriusDragEditPartsTrackerEx@ has the responsibility to find the correct @SnapHelper@ according to the "targetUnderMouse" (in @org.eclipse.gef.tools.DragEditPartsTracker.setTargetEditPart(EditPart)@).
When moving a border node, the "targetUnderMouse" is an @AbstractDiagramNodeEditPart@ (parent is a Node) or an @AbstractDNodeContainerCompartmentEditPart@ (parent is a container).
The policy that displays the feedback (guide line) is @SiriusSnapFeedbackPolicy@.
The @SiriusSnapToGeometry@ is responsible to compute the element to snap with (and so x and y coordinates to snap with). 

h2. Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths

h3. Metamodel Changes

No metamodel changes.
  
h3. API Changes

All the changes will be mainly internal to the edit part and associated policies. So there will be no API changes for this feature.

h3. User Interface Changes

No user interface change.

h3. Documentation Changes

This new behavior should be added in the New and Noteworthy documentation. 
The limitation "??This feature is not enabled on border nodes.??" in the diagram documentation should be removed.

h2. Tests and Non-regression strategy

The class @org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.SnapAllShapesTest@ must be completed with border nodes cases:
* Border node on node in diagram
* Border node on node in container
* Border node on container
* Border node on list
* Border node on border node

h2. Implementation choices and tradeoffs

For the case of collapsed border nodes, it would be interesting to snap the expanded bounds (and not the collapsed state). But the "snap to" mechanism is generic to all kind of nodes and associated to the figure representing the node. It would be too impacting to try to manage the expanded state.
