h2. Introduction

Currently, the _Copy Appearance Properties_ action is not consistent with the _Size Both_ action which uses the last selected element as base size. The _Copy Appearance Properties_ action uses the first selected element as base style. Furthermore, the last selected element is highlighted in a way that suggests this one is the reference to copy the style or the size.

h2. Detailed Specification

Taking the following selection:
!selectionBefore.png!
The last selected element is the dark border node. We can also notice that the last selection is highlighted with black handles. When applying the _Size Both_ action the two other selected elements take the last selection size:
!sizeBoth.png!
However, when applying the _Copy Appearance Properties_ action, its the first selection which is taken into account:
!copyAppearance.png!

This enhancement aims to modify this action to have a similar behavior to the Size Both Action.

h2. Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths


h3. Metamodel Changes

There is no metamodel changes for this feature.

h3. API Changes

We do not intend to change any API.

h3. User Interface Changes

The end-user will see the new behavior of the _Copy Appearance Properties_ action. The tooltip of the action will also be changed.

h3. Documentation Changes

The release note and the end user documentation will be updated.

h2. Tests and Non-regression strategy

We will add a new SWTBot that checks the result of applying the _Copy Appearance Properties_ Action. This test will check with two and several selected elements if at the end, all the elements have the appearance of the last selection.

h2. Implementation choices and tradeoffs

Since this action is defined in GMF we need to duplicate it. A patch will be suggested in GMF to modify this behavior.
