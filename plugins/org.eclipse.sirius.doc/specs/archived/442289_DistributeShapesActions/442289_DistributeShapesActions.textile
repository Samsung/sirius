h2. Introduction

Distribute actions are often available in graphical/drawing soft ("LibreOffice":https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Distribution , "Inskape":http://en.flossmanuals.net/inkscape/positioning-objects/align-and-distribute , "Visio":http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/visio-help/distribute-shapes-HP001231368.aspx , ...). This kind of actions is very useful and misses in Sirius.
The goal of this feature is to remedy this problem.

4 new actions allowing to distribute shapes will be added:
** Distribute centers evenly horizontally !images/distributeCentersHorizontal.png!
** Distribute with uniform gaps horizontally !images/distributeWithUniformGapHorizontal.png!
** Distribute centers evenly vertically !images/distributeCentersVertical.png!
** Distribute with uniform gaps vertically !images/distributeWithUniformGapVertical.png!

h2. Detailed Specification

These actions will be available in the tabbar in a drop down menu similar to and located after the _Align_ actions menu. The default action of this drop down menu will be _Distribute Horizontally With Uniform Gaps_.
They will also be in the _Diagram_ menu from the Eclipse menu bar and in the contextual _Format_ menu when diagram elements are selected.
They will be enabled only for selected nodes with same direct parent. At least 3 shapes should be selected to enable distribute actions.
For border nodes, they will be enabled only if all selected border nodes have the same parent and are on the same axis (top and bottom sides for horizontal actions, left and right for vertical actions). The overlap is forbidden for border nodes, so in some conditions (location already used), these actions may not have accurate results.

For all actions, the first and the last shapes do not move.

h3. First and last shapes

The first and last shapes do not depend on the selection order. They depend on the location of each selected shapes and the chosen action.

For horizontal distribution with uniform gaps:
* the first shape is the leftmost one (with the minimum x location). If several shapes have the same x location, the highest one is the first.
* the last shape is the rightmost one (with the right side with the maximum x coordinate). If several shapes are aligned to the right, the lowest one is the last.

For horizontal centered distribution:
* the first shape is the leftmost one (with its center at the minimum x coordinate). If several shapes are aligned on center, the one with the highest center is the first.
* the last shape is the rightmost one (with its center at the maximum x coordinate). If several shapes are aligned by center, the one with the lowest center is the last.

For vertical distribution with uniform gaps:
* the first shape is the highest one (with the minimum y location). If several shapes have the same y location, the leftmost one is the first.
* the last shape is the lowest one (with the bottom side with the maximum y coordinate). If several shapes are aligned to the bottom, the rightmost one is the last.

For vertical centered distribution:
* the first shape is the highest one (with its center at the minimum y coordinate). If several shapes are aligned on middle, the leftmost one is the first.
* the last shape is the lowest one (with the bottom side with the maximum y coordinate). If several shapes are aligned by middle, the rightmost one is the last.

Information: When speaking above of the right or the bottom side, the border nodes of a shape are ignored.

h3. Distribute centers evenly

With this action, the gap between centers of each selected shapes will be the same.

Initial state

Result after having launched the _distribute centers evenly horizontally_ action

h3. Distribute with uniform gaps

With this action, the gap between the left side and the right side of each consecutive shapes will be the same.

Result after having launched the _distribute with uniform gaps horizontally_ action (from the same initial state)

h3. Overlap

Overlap could happen, or in other words, the gap can be negative.

Initial state
!images/initialState2.png!

Result after after having launched the _distribute with uniform gaps horizontally_ action

h3. Sequence diagram

These actions are not enabled on sequence diagrams. The layout, and hence the gaps between objects, are conditioned by the model itself.

h3. Pin status

If the preference _Sirius/Sirius Diagram/Automatically mark moved elements as pinned_ is checked, these actions have no effect on pin status (as for existing align actions).

h2. Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths

h3. Metamodel Changes

No metammodel changes.

h3. API Changes

There will be no change in existing API.

h3. User Interface Changes

A new drop down menu will be added to the diagram editor toolbar.
The _Diagram_ menu from Eclipse menu bar and the contextual _Format_ menu will be completed with the new actions.

h3. Documentation Changes

Diagram editor documentation will be updated to describe these new actions.

h2. Tests and Non-regression strategy

At least one test for each added action.
At least one of them with zoom and scroll-bar.
One test with negative gap.
One test with 2 shapes at same axis (top, bottom, middle, left, right, center according to action launched) to check first and last shape computing
Several tests for disablement checking: 2 shapes selected, several shapes not at same level, border nodes not on same side.

h2. Implementation choices and tradeoffs

These actions could be contributed to GMF through "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=290898":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=290898
