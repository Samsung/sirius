h1. SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter

The @org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter@ interface is designed to disable the proxy resolution of the InverseCrossReferencer.

This capability is typically used to prevent loading a resource during its unloading.

Furthermore, it is not recommended to add other ECrossReferenceAdapter additionally to those created by Sirius. Note that you can get the semantic CrossReferencer with @org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.Session.getSemanticCrossReferencer()@.

However, in the case where an additional custom ECrossReferenceAdapter is needed, it should extend @org.eclipse.sirius.common.tools.api.util.SiriusCrossReferenceAdapterImpl@ or at least implement @SiriusCrossReferenceAdapter@ with the same implementation as @SiriusCrossReferenceAdapterImpl@.
Otherwise, there is no guarantee that load during unload won't come up.
