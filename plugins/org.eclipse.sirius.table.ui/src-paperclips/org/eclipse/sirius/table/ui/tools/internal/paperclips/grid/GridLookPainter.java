	 * @param gc
	 *            the graphics context to paint on.
	 * @param x
	 *            the x coordinate of the top-left of the grid.
	 * @param y
	 *            the y coordinate of the top-left of the grid.
	 * @param columns
	 *            the column widths. The left and right margins of each cell are
	 *            included in the column widths.
	 * @param headerRows
	 *            the header row heights.
	 * @param headerColSpans
	 *            a two-dimensional array of cell spans in the header. Each
	 *            element in the outer array is a header row. Each element of an
	 *            inner array is a cell, where the element value indicates how
	 *            many columns the cell spans.
	 * @param firstRowIndex
	 *            the zero-based index of the first row displayed on the page.
	 * @param topOpen
	 *            whether the top body row should be drawn with the top edge of
	 *            the cell border "open." An open top border is a visual
	 *            indication that the top row is being continued from the
	 *            previous page.
	 * @param bodyRows
	 *            the body row heights.
	 * @param bodyColSpans
	 *            a two-dimensional array of cell spans in the body. Each
	 *            element in the outer array is a body row. Each element of an
	 *            inner array is a cell, where the element value indicates how
	 *            many columns the cell spans.
	 * @param bottomOpen
	 *            whether the bottom body row should be drawn with the bottom
	 *            edge of the cell border "open." An open bottom border is a
	 *            visual indication that the bottom row will be continued on the
	 *            next page.
	 * @param footerRows
	 *            the footer row heights.
	 * @param footerColSpans
	 *            a two-dimensional array of cell spans in the footer. Each
	 *            element in the outer array is a footer row. Each element of an
	 *            inner array is a cell, where the element value indicates how
	 *            many columns the cell spans.
