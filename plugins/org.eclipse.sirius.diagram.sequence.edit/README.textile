h1. Sirius Sequence Diagrams Meta-model Edit Support (@org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.sequence.edit@) 

This bundle contains the @.edit@ support for the sequence diagrams metamodel, which is itself in the @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.sequence@ bundle. The source code contained in @src-gen@ is 100% generated by EMF from the genmodel (no manual customization).

This bundle also registers the "Sequence Diagram" type of diagram into Sirius, so that it is available from the __New Child__ menus in the VSM editor. This is done in the @plugin.xml@ and in @src/fr/obeo/dsl/viewpoint/diagram/sequence/edit/diagramtype/SequenceDiagramTypeProvider.java@.
